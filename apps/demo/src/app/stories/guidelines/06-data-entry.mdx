import { Meta, Canvas, Story } from '@storybook/blocks';

<Meta title="Guidelines/Data entry" />

# Data entry

<Canvas>
  <Story id="atoms-input--input"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Placeholders

Fields do not include placeholders.

### Motivation

#### Cognitive misleading

The presence of information in the field might convey misleading information to the user, making them think the field is already filled with some helpful information without interaction requirements.
